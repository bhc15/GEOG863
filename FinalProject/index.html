        <h2>Voter Turnout in the 2016 U.S. Election</h2>
        <p>According to the U.S. Census, more than 137 million votes were cast in the 2016 U.S. election. Yet there
            were an estimated 224 million Americans that were 18 or older and therefore eligible to vote.</p>
        <p>Nationally, the overall percentage of eligible citizens that voted was 61.4 percent. However, there were
            substantial disparities in voter turnout among age groups, with older voters turning out at much
            higher rates than younger voters.</p>
