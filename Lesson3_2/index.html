    <h3>Lesson Reflections</h3>
    <p>This week's lesson was both challenging and informative. Up to this point, my programming experience has been limited to Python 
    so I learned quite a lot about JavaScript by following the <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/js/" target="_blank"> W3Schools tutorial</a>. 
    In particular, I noticed quite a few similarities between the two languages when it comes to data types, properties, and methods. Additionally, 
    I was excited to see that this lesson provided an introduction to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. I first saw this API being demonstrated earlier this year 
    at the Esri Dev Summit in Palm Springs but haven't had a chance to dive into it prior to this course. As the course progresses, I'm looking forward 
    to becoming more familiar with the API and more comfortable navigating the API reference.</p>
