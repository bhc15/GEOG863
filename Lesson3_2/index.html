    <h3>Lesson Reflections</h3>
    <p>This week's lesson was both challenging and informative. Up to this point, my programming experience has been limited to Python 
    so I learned quite a lot about JavaScript by following the <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/js/" target="_blank"> W3Schools tutorial</a> 
    (although I did feel that the content was redundant in places). In particular, I noticed quite a few similarities between the two languages when it comes 
    to data types, properties, and methods. There are some important differences with respect to syntax, however, which will require repetition and more 
    practice to fully master.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I was excited to see that this lesson provided an introduction to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. I first saw this API being demonstrated 
    earlier this year at the Esri Dev Summit in Palm Springs but haven't had a chance to dive into it prior to this course. As the course progresses, I'm 
    looking forward to becoming more familiar with the API and more comfortable navigating the API reference. For this week's assignment, I was able to figure 
    out how to add content, including an image, to a pop-up. I did try experimenting with adding different content types to the pop-up (e.g., text, image) but 
    could not quite figure it out. Fortunately, I was able to add an image by using HTML.</p>
